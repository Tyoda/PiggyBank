# PiggyBank
Are you tired of managing coins in your inventory and you are also scared of the bank? Piggy banks might just be the thing for you!

This mod adds an, allegedly, very cute piggy bank to the game, in which you can deposit your hard earned coins for later retrieval...by force...

# Features
 - Create a clay piggy bank with your hands!

## On a serious note:
 - Coins can be deposited into the piggy bank after which the piggy bank's weight grows by the coin's weight
 - You have no idea how much money is in any given piggy bank, your only clue is how much it weighs.
 - Throw it at an assortment of hard items and tiles to retrieve the goodies!

### On a less serious note:

Don't forget to paint your piggy banks pink for the complete experience!
